## Client requirements

**Brief**

> You are the accountant of a tennis club. You are also a renowned Front End developer who knows they cannot do anything without you. The first task in your list is to prepare a registration form for new users, which takes them to a welcome page with a list of all players in the club.  
> You also want to make the website pleasant to use, to make it attractive to potential new club members, so you know all the tricks to make the user experience as neat as possible, with good use of colors and fonts.

**You may use**

> HTML for markup (of course)

> Either plain CSS or a preprocessor, such as Sass/LESS. Use of UI frameworks such as Bootstrap is acceptable

> JavaScript or a JavaScript library/framework for interaction

> Save your code in a repository using version control software

**Things to consider**

> The register page will be used on desktop and mobile devices

> It should ask at least for name, surname, email address and – of course – a password

> It may be useful for the user to know when they have made an error when using the form, and where

> When the user clicks ‘Register’, display the submitted data in the console as a JSON object

> A successful registration should take the user to a welcome page with the list of players in descending order by points, but it would be nice if they could be sorted by other parameters

> You may want to collect a user’s nationality, favorite Pokémon or favorite Star Wars character. Consider connecting to an API and displaying data in a dropdown for the user to select  
> Countries – https://restcountries.com/  
> Pokémon – https://pokeapi.co/  
> Star Wars - https://swapi.dev/

**Enjoy a challenge?**

> Consider integrating the login form with the registration form, for returning users.
